# Python for Data Analysis Project :

As my dataset was not available online anymore, I asked M. BEJNBAUM that told me to choose whatever dataset that would please me. So after a few research I decided to take [this one](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+consumption+%28quantified%29). It's a dataset that represent that drug consumption and quantifies it.

The first thing you should do is take a look at the Jupyter Notebook `Python_Project.ipynb`. It is well commented and is about the data visualization and the modelisation part.
Here are the packages that are necessary to run this notebook :
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `searborn`
- `sk-learn`
- `pickle`
- `flask`
- `requests`
- `json`
